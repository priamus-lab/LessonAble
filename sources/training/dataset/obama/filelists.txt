wavs/DNCNBCNews_0.wav|good evening everybody.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_1.wav|as you've seen by now this isn't a normal convention.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_2.wav|because what we do these next seventy six days will echo through generations to come.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_3.wav|i'm in philadelphia where our constitution was drafted and signed.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_4.wav|but embedded in this document was a north star that would guide future generations.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_5.wav|a system of representative government, a democracy through which we could better realize our highest ideals.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_6.wav|regardless of what we look like how we worship who we love how much money we have or who we voted for.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_7.wav|but we should also expect a president to be the custodian of this democracy.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_8.wav|i have sat in the oval office with both of the men who are running for president.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_9.wav|i never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_10.wav|i did hope for the sake of our country that donald trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_11.wav|that he might come to feel the weight of the office.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_12.wav|and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_13.wav|but he never did.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_14.wav|for close to four years now he has shown no interest in putting in the work no interest in finding common ground.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_15.wav|no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_16.wav|donald trump hasn't grown into the job because he can't.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_17.wav|and the consequences of that failure are severe.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_18.wav|one hundred and seventy zero americans dead.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_19.wav|millions of jobs gone while those at the top taken more than ever.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_20.wav|our worst impulses unleashed.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_21.wav|our proud reputation around the world badly diminished.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_22.wav|and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_23.wav|now i know that in times as polarized as these most of you have already made up your mind.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_24.wav|but maybe you're still not sure which candidate you'll vote for or whether you'll vote at all.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_25.wav|so let me tell you about my friend joe biden.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_26.wav|twelve years ago when i began my search for a vice president i didn't know i'd end up finding a brother.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_27.wav|joe is a man who learned early on to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_28.wav|living by the words his parents taught.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_29.wav|him no one's better than you joe but you're better than nobody.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_30.wav|when he talks with someone who's lost her job joe remembers the night his father sat him down to say that he'd lost his.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_31.wav|when he meets with military families who've lost their hero.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_32.wav|who is more than prepared for the job.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_33.wav|someone who knows what it's like to overcome barriers and who's made a career.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_34.wav|fighting to help others live out their own american dream.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_35.wav|they'll expand healthcare to more americans like joe and i did ten years ago.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_36.wav|when he helped craft the affordable care act and nail down the votes to make it the law.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_37.wav|and he sees this moment now not as a chance to get back to where we were.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_38.wav|but to make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_39.wav|whether it's the waitress trying to raise a kid on her own or the shift worker always on the edge of getting laid off.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_40.wav|or the student figuring out how to pay for next semester's classes.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_41.wav|he knows that our true strength comes from setting an example.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_42.wav|poverty and disease.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_43.wav|and that they care deeply about this democracy.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_44.wav|that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_45.wav|depend on a fidelity to facts and science and logic and not just making stuff up.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_46.wav|none of this should be controversial.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_47.wav|here's the thing no single american can fix this country alone not even a president.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_48.wav|democracy was never meant to be transactional you give me your vote i make everything better.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_49.wav|it requires an active and informed citizenry.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_50.wav|so i'm also asking you to believe in your own ability.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_51.wav|our democracy.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_52.wav|than to make progress.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_53.wav|and why a black mom might feel like it never looked out for her at all.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_54.wav|i understand why a new immigrant might look around this country and wonder whether there's still a place for him here.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_55.wav|why a young person might look at politics right now.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_56.wav|the circus of it all the meanness and the lies.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_57.wav|and conspiracy theories and think what is the point.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_58.wav|they know they can't win you over with their policies.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_59.wav|so they're hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote and to convince you that your vote does not matter.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_60.wav|that is how they win that is how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life and the lives of the people you love.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_61.wav|that's how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and wellconnected.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_62.wav|how our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_63.wav|that's how a democracy withers until it's no democracy at all.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_64.wav|and we cannot let that happen.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_65.wav|do not let them take away your power.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_66.wav|do not let them take away your democracy.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_67.wav|make a plan right now for how you are going to get involved and vote.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_68.wav|do it as early as you can and tell your family and friends how they can vote too.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_69.wav|do what americans have done for over two centuries when faced with even tougher times than this.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_70.wav|all those quiet heroes who found the courage to keep marshy keep pushing in the face of hardship and injustice.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_71.wav|one of them told me he never imagined he'd walk into the white house and see a president who looked like his grandson.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_72.wav|trying to end jim crow segregation in the south.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_73.wav|what we do echoes through generations.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_74.wav|whatever our backgrounds we are all the children of americans who fought the good fight.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_75.wav|irish and italians and asians and latinos told go back where you come from.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_76.wav|jews and catholics muslims and sikhs made to feel suspect for the way they worshipped.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_77.wav|black americans chained and whipped.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_78.wav|and hanged spit on for trying to sit at lunch counters.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_79.wav|beaten for trying to vote.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_80.wav|our ancestors they were on the receiving end of a democracy that had fallen short all their lives.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_81.wav|they knew how far the daily reality of america strayed from the mid.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_82.wav|we are going to bring those words in our founding documents to life.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_83.wav|i have seen that same spirit rising these past few years.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_84.wav|folks of every age and background who packed city centers and airports and rural roads so that families wouldn't be separated.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_85.wav|so that another classroom wouldn't get shot up.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_86.wav|so that our kids won't grow up on an uninhabitable planet.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_87.wav|americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_88.wav|to the young people who led us this summer telling us we need to be better.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_89.wav|in so many ways you are this country's dreams fulfilled.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_90.wav|you can give our democracy new meaning.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_91.wav|you can take it to a better place.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_92.wav|this administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that's what it takes for them to win.
wavs/DNCNBCNews_93.wav|stay safe god bless.
